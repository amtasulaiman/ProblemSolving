# ProblemSolving
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with low-level Unix/POSIX system calls related to processes, signal handling, files, and I/O redirection. This program, called polya , which manages a collection of "worker" processes that concurrently
engage in solving computationally intensive problems.


Main goals:
Understand process execution: forking, executing, and reaping.
Understand signal handling.
Understand the use of "dup" to perform I/O redirection.
Have gained experience with C libraries and system calls.
Have enhanced your C programming abilities.
